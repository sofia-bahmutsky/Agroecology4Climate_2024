# What is Holos

The Holos model estimates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and changes in soil carbon content on Canadian farms, helping users explore ways to reduce emissions and increase soil carbon content. Users can input farm-specific data and adjust management practices such as livestock diets or farming practices. The model utilizes climate, soil, and agronomic data to calculate emissions from a variety of sources, including crops, livestock, and energy use.

# What is PyHolos

PyHolos is a model that integrates the Holos greenhouse gas emissions calculation module into the LiteFarm framework, specifically focusing on nitrous oxide (ùëÅ2ùëÇ) emissions from crop residues. It enhances the original Holos model to provide more accurate calculations of ùëÅ2ùëÇ emissions related to crop residue management.

# Goal

Our project will work to enhance the existing emissions model, PyHolos, by incorporating plot-level interventions and increasing the dynamicity of the model parameters, with the hope of making the model more applicable to different regions. Throughout this process we aim to base our work in agroecological and agronomic principles, while also contemplating farmer accessibility and implementation. Specifically, we intend to achieve the following objectives:  


Update the existing PyHolos model to increase the dynamicity of the model equations, making sure to reinforce this work with agronomic principles. The initial focus will be on expanding across Canada, then to other regions of the world.  

Utilize experimental data from the UBC farm as a test bed for the PyHolos model to better inform model parameters.  For instance, we hope to draw on the cause-and-effect relationships established through the numerous agricultural experiments conducted at the UBC Farm to help us identify the emission contributions generated by specific farming inputs and practices.
